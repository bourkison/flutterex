# FlutterEx

## Introduction
FlutterEx is a peer-to-peer punting service that is designed to take bookmakers out of the gambling equation. Rather than betting against a bookmaker, users can put contracts out onto the exchange that other users can then take on. This provides a more free market for betters (without manipulation from bookmakers), arguably making the system more fair.

## Example
Let's say I believe that the Lakers are going to defeat the Warriors in an upcoming game. I am so confident of this that I would be willing to put $10 down, seeking a return of at least $15 (inclusive of initial investment).
This would then create a contract on the site for the Warriors to win that any user could pick up, requiring a $5 investment for the entire $15 return.

## Why?
This thought occured to me while watching a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efBG1YfuNhg) on the Hong Kong Jockey Club, which works similarly to a stock exchange. Due to the heavy cost of gambling licenses as well as me having no experience in gambling, this project will never see the light of day. I also have no clue if this already exists/has existed in the past, rather it has been a project for me to learn Typescript and React; two frameworks that I have not worked with before.

## Tools Used
This application uses:
* React
* AWS Amplify
* MongoDB
* Typescript
